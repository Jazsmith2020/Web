  <h1>Questions not to ask a Transgender woman…</h1>
  <p class="same">
You think in this modern-day and age…certain questions you ask someone would be nothing about their private parts or about where they are in the process of becoming a woman? I never thought that throughout this whole transition I would be getting asked awkward questions about my body. I just never thought my body was anyone's business to talk about? Because I would never ask anyone about their private parts or body.<br>
How would you answer if you were asked certain questions like… did you get surgery down there? Or how far along are you in your transition? So are you gay? What is your sexuality? Are you a woman or a man? What bathroom do you use? What is your real name? What's the difference between a drag queen, crossdresser, or transvestite? Do they still call your kind transvestites? How do you have sex?<br>
Questions like this seem to be so arrogant yet people might be curious cause they just don’t know. Well first maybe get to know the person before actually asking questions like this. This is where a little self-talk or self-control would come in handy. Maybe think before you speak. Ask yourself would you like to be asked these questions. Are these questions appropriate to ask? And is it anyone's business? <br>
Personally, I just wouldn’t go there. I don’t need to know about anyone's private parts or their gender to figure out if they are a genuinely nice person or not? I don’t need to know how they have sex or what to call them? Because in my eyes people are people. I may ask them what are their pronouns if I'm in an LGBTQ setting or a gay event, or even just to be considerate.<br>
When I was younger and I knew I was gay, being asked if I was gay didn’t offend me. Because I was gay. It's like people knew you were gay, and they just knew what goes on in the bedroom. But for some crazy reason, transwomen are sexualized and treated differently. It's like we don’t deserve common decency or like it's wrong.  I don’t find being born in the wrong body and becoming who you were supposed to be, wrong. I found myself in my transition and I still keep discovering more about myself through it.<br>
It takes a lot for me to get offended, but when someone is just asking these questions and you answer them. Then they say, well I don’t get it. Why? Uh, why? Well let me ask you this if your son or daughter knew she was different and was so unhappy because they felt like they were born in the wrong body, wouldn’t you want them to be happy even though you know the journey might be hard. Wouldn’t you want yourself to be happy if you were in that situation? And would you like to be asked these questions?<br>
So maybe next time you want to ask these questions or you meet someone for the first time who may appear transgender. Think, would you like to be asked these questions, and is it any of your business. Be considerate and just think before you speak.
Thank you

<h1>An Unconventional Marriage…</h1>
<p class="same">
  So I have been married, going on 4 years, and it's been one heck of a journey. Yes, marriage to everyone is something different.  I value and love my marriage and we have definitely faced our challenges by us being a transwoman and straight man couple. Although this status has changed.<br>
  So let me start from the beginning. When we started dating, he told his family he started dating me and that I was transgender. When he did his family stopped talking to him for 3 months. His grandpa was the first one who started talking to us. Which helped the rest of his family open us to us.  It was heartbreaking. <br>
  So after 30 days, we decided to go away with some friends and they wanted us to pay for half the trip and not have a say where we went in the states. Which we didn’t like so we decided to do our own trip and go to Vegas. That’s when my boyfriend, my husband now, decided that we should go to Vegas and eloped. He asked me then if I wanted to get married and I said sure, why not, YOLO lol. <br>
  So the day came and it was exactly 37 days of knowing each other, we were in vegas, I was engaged for 1 day and on the 37th day, we got married on the strip, in front of the Bellagio fountains. It was not only an amazing experience it was a memorable one. I got married with Bumblebee at my wedding and Goofy haha. <br>
  So when we left Vegas we decided to move my whole house to Vancouver because my husband was offered a high-paying job. I gave my notice at work and we left 2 weeks after we got married. We got to BC with a loaded car, everything in storage, and found a cheap room on a blueberry farm in Pitt Meadows.
  Now with my family, my mother didn’t believe I actually got married, she met my husband 2 months after I was married and already living in Vancouver. She was loving and very welcoming. My family loves him and gives him the same respect they give me. Which he loves because his family wasn’t too open to us being married. <br>
  We faced many challenges throughout our marriage but still never let any of that affect how we love each other or treat each other. I found if you communicate properly, speak about our feelings, and what bothers us, everything works out just fine and that works for us. <br>
  Today we may have faced new challenges, and made mistakes. But that still doesn’t change how much we love one another…<br>
  So when someone says, you can't get married or your not the type for marriage. You are! I used to think the same way, but now…my marriage, unconventional or not, is perfect for me…
  Thank you,
  A transgender woman...xoxo

<h1>Growing up Native but not knowing what that means…</h1>
  <p class="same">
So this topic may be controversial but it's something I struggled with growing up. I was a Cree first nations child going to school in a Caucasian town, and at the time they called us Indians. But I had no idea what the difference was, between the white kids and native kids like me.  Just that my skin was a bit darker than all the other boys and girls I grew up with. Throughout my childhood, I never understood why being native was so bad or what was wrong with us.<br>
I was always so proud of my family and where I came from, so as I went throughout elementary school all the way to high school. I realized how different it was to be native. How people looked down on us because of the color of our skin.  But at the time I was always so happy because I knew how hard my mom worked and how hard my whole family worked just for us to grow up in a good home. <br>
I remember the first time not being picked for teams in school because of what color my skin was. It was a horrible feeling. I remember my teachers picking on me and treating me differently. I remember seeing my mom flip out on one of the teachers because of how they treated me and my brother. Although my brothers' childhood was different from mine because he played sports and well, I was different. <br>
I loved playing with girlie stuff, lipstick, high heels, my mom's girlie stuff, and my sister's barbies. I used to play barbies with all my girl cousins and it was a blast. But because I was different and didn’t like the same things boys my age liked, I was picked on. I was pushed around, teased, bullied, beat up, and I knew deep down that a huge part of it was still because of the color of my skin. <br>
When I think back at all the time I was bullied and how I felt, it brings tears to my eyes. Thinking why would anyone want to bully a little brown-skinned geeky looking boy. Why me? What was wrong with me? This is something every mother never wants their own child to go through. Maybe this is why I am the way I am. <br>
Anyways as I got older, I realized what it really meant to be native, what rights we lost, what happened to the elders before us, residential school, racism, and losing our culture. I struggle to this day about my culture because I never really grew up as a Cree speaking child. I remember my great-grandma speaking Cree and my grandma but other than that we were always speaking English. <br>
I also remember hearing about pow wows and traditional native culture. I just thought, oh maybe our family is different, not knowing that our family was one of those families that lost their culture too. I remember being ashamed of being native, being ashamed of the color of my skin, being ashamed for being different. <br>
But as an adult, I'm proud of who I am. I'm proud to be a Cree First Nations Transwoman. I'm proud to be a Gladue, I'm proud to be where I am from and I'm proud to be brown-skinned.
Thank you,
A transgender woman…xoxo
