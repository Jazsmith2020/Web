<h1>About me...</h1>
<p class="same">My name is Jazmine Smith. I am a First Nations Cree Transwoman, living in North Vancouver, BC. with my partner and two dogs. I am an aspiring filmmaker, designer, and makeup artist. I have written, directed, and starred in my own short film about my life, called "I am me",which you will be able to view in the Short film section of the menu. It has been screened at Berlinale, ImagineNative, and many other festivals around the world. I have been a certified makeup artist for 8 years, picking up tips and tricks on my way. I dabble in graphic design, own my own business, and I design and make jewelery. I found that you can have many passions throughout life, whether it be love, friendships, hobbies or careers. You are not limited to one career, whoever said that was silly. I want to do so much and be so much, so here it is...a part of my journey, Welcome, to my space, Jazmine's Space.
<br><p>Of course down below are little tips and tricks I learned throughout my makeup career, and some of my favorite brand of cosmetics.</p></br>

<h1>Makeup Tips</h1>
    <p>What helps for gel liner? I use a product called Inglot Duraline. You can mix a drop of it with any eyeshadow or gel liner to make it a water proof gel liner.</p>
    <p>To have matte finish look. When applying your foundation, dab where you are putting it, then spray your matte setting spray before you blend the fooundation on to your skin. This will help set your foundation, making your skin look matte.</p>
    <p>When doing your eyebrows...use a brush and gel, brush up your eyebrows, the draw a line above where you want your eye brows, then draw a line below your brow. Once you have the shape of your eyebrow. Fill in your brow with the gel. Brush it up and how you want your eye brow. Done! </p>
